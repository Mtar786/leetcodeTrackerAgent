"""Summarisation utilities for LeetCode problems.

This module provides functions to generate concise summaries of problem
statements using OpenAI's language models. A summary aims to distil
the problem requirements, constraints, and key solution ideas into a
few sentences. It can optionally include highâ€‘level solution notes.

The summariser assumes that you have registered for an OpenAI API key
and have installed the ``openai`` Python package. You can obtain an API
key at https://openai.com/api/ and install the library via
``pip install openai``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    problem: LeetCodeProblem
        The problem metadata used for context and to construct the summary.
    description: str
        The HTML content of the problem statement.
    model: str, optional
        OpenAI model identifier. Defaults to ``gpt-4-turbo``.
    temperature: float, optional
        Sampling temperature used for generation. Defaults to ``0.3``.
    max_tokens: int, optional
        Maximum tokens allowed in the summary response. Defaults to ``400``.
    openai_api_key: Optional[str], optional
        Explicit API key used to authenticate with OpenAI. If not provided,
